## Schema

### Required

- `interface` (String) Name of the interface.
- `name` (String) Changing the name of this resource will force it to be recreated.
	> The links of other configuration properties to this resource may be lost!
	> Changing the name of the resource outside of a Terraform will result in a loss of control integrity for that resource!

### Optional

- `___id___` (Number) <em>Resource ID type (.id / name). This is an internal service field, setting a value is not required.</em>
- `___path___` (String) <em>Resource path for CRUD operations. This is an internal service field, setting a value is not required.</em>
- `add_arp` (Boolean) Whether to add dynamic ARP entry.
- `address_pool` (String) IP pool, from which to take IP addresses for the clients. If set to static-only, then only the clients that have a static lease (added in lease submenu) will be allowed.
- `allow_dual_stack_queue` (Boolean) Creates a single simple queue entry for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, uses the MAC address and DUID for identification. Requires IPv6 DHCP Server to have this option enabled as well to work properly.
- `always_broadcast` (Boolean) Always send replies as broadcasts even if destination IP is known.
- `authoritative` (String) Option changes the way how a server responds to DHCP requests.

- `src_address` (String) The address which the DHCP client must send requests to in order to renew an IP address lease.
